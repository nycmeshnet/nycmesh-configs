# nycmesh-configs

Configuration templates for NYC Mesh

These configs drive the [configgen.nycmesh.net](https://configgen.nycmesh.net) website. The website's code [nycmesh-configgen](https://github.com/nycmeshnet/nycmesh-configgen) uses Git Tags to determine which configs are available. Don't forget to create a [new tag](https://github.com/nycmeshnet/nycmesh-configs/tags) after merging changes! GitHub Releases are not used.
